🧠 75 Days Hard Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 75 Days Hard Coding Challenge — a personal journey dedicated to improving my coding logic, consistency, and problem-solving skills across multiple programming languages.

🚀 About the Challenge

This challenge is all about discipline and growth.
For the next 75 days, I’ll be coding every single day — learning new concepts, solving problems, and building small projects using different technologies.

The goal is not perfection, but progress. Each day counts, and each line of code adds up to something bigger.

💻 Tech Stack & Languages

Throughout the challenge, I’ll be exploring and practicing:

🐍 Python — problem-solving & automation

💪 C++ — algorithms & logic building

⚙️ C — core programming fundamentals

🌐 HTML & CSS — front-end structure & styling

🗄️ SQL — data management and queries

⚡ Plus other technologies as I progress

📅 Daily Structure

Each day will include:

✅ Practice problems or coding exercises

✅ Small projects or mini-tasks

✅ Notes and key takeaways

✅ Clean and commented code

🏁 Goals

Build the habit of coding daily

Strengthen logical and analytical skills

Learn new programming concepts

Build a solid portfolio of projects

Stay consistent and accountable
